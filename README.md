# Student Internship Application

This is a web-based application that allows students to submit information about their internships through a data entry survey form, which will be stored in a relational database. The system also provides administrative forms for maintaining pick-list items and managing student submissions.

## Features

The application has the following features:

* Student survey form: A data entry form that allows students to fill out information about their internships, including free text items such as descriptions of duties and pick-list items such as company names.
* Search form: A form that allows users to search for internships that meet certain criteria. Search results are displayed as a list of submissions.
* Tagging system: Each internship submission includes tags that describe the duties, company, technologies, and other relevant information. Students can select pre-defined tags or enter new ones when filling out the survey form. Tags can be used to search and filter internships for specific criteria.
